# Java → JavaScript Conversion (Full Project)
- Kept class names (PascalCase), preserved folder structure and file mapping 1:1 (.java → .js).
- Converted CONSTANT_NAMES and By locator UPPER_SNAKE to camelCase (e.g., RESULT_PASS → resultPass, DISTRIBUTOR_INPUT → distributorInput).
- Converted method names to JS-friendly camelCase (loginNPP → loginNpp).
- Method bodies are left as TODO stubs with the original Java included below for accurate manual translation.
- Next steps: fill method bodies using async/await where necessary; add Mocha tests mirroring TestNG.
